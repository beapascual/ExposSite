	<div class="description"><p>1nternet  ¥appers is a group made up of four students in Professor Carlson's writing class at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. These students were recently tasked with writing an essay which encompassed in-depth research about a technological innovation that was introduced within their lifetime. Despite writing about drastically different technological innovations, the four of them discovered a common theme within each of their essays. Each student admitted that technology made several tedious tasks much more convenient. At the same time, they warned against a dangerous dependence on technology that has started to develop throughout our current society. Join these students as they turn their combined efforts into a visual representation of the impact of technology on our lives.</p>
