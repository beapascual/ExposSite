			<h3>Bea Pascual</h3>
			<h4>Innovation: iPhone</h4>
			<p>In this essay, Bea writes about the original iPhone and how its revolutionary design shaped the smartphones that exist today. She explains how the iPhone was the first to place an "emphasis on simple interaction," and was responsible for popularizing the use of pre-installed apps which have become a trademark of today's smartphones. However, people have grown to become reliant on cell phones, and it's possible our reliance will soon become so strong that we won't know how to function without them.</p>

			<h3>Serena Nam </h3>
			<h4>Innovation: Buy Now, Pay Later</h4>
			<p>In this essay, Serena writes about the serious impacts regarding the increasing trust we as a society are beginning to place on the internet. She focuses specifically on the growing use of the online shopping tool "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL), which allows consumers to break up expensive purchases into smaller installments to be paid over time. As younger generations continue to be influenced by the 'latest trends' showcased on social media platforms, BNPL will almost certainly develop into a tool that justifies overspending and normalizes debt. </p>

			<h4>Innovation: Delivery Drones</h4>
			<p>In this essay, Josh writes about the alarming potential technology has to take over human jobs, specifically regarding delivery services.
