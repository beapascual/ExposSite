			<h4>Introduction:</h4>
			<p>In a world constantly in motion, the quest for convenience has long been at the heart of human innovation. Every invention and discovery has inherently been driven by the human desire to make our lives easier and quicker. From the invention of the wheel and the discovery of fire, to the development of motor vehicles and gas stoves, there are innumerable examples that can be cited that solidify the reason behind innovation. Although technology has provided convenience and new ways of connectivity, our reliance on technology has created an illusion of added control, when in reality, we are being consumed by technology and losing control of our lives.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the days before the digital revolution, convenience was often limited by whatever was physically around you - local grocers stocking up on your favorite products, an ATM close by that made sure you never ran out of cash, etc. People spent hours banking in person and shopping at shops in their locality, limited to the constraints of the region. However, as technology continues to advance, convenience has surpassed these physical limits and moved into the online world.

			<h4>Positive Impacts:</h4>
			<p>
	In December 2019, our world was greatly impacted by a global pandemic known as the Coronavirus disease. As people around the world moved indoors to protect themselves and prevent the illness from spreading, technology was not only a convenience but an essential part of our lives. Everyday activities such as shopping for groceries and ordering food were forced to become tasks we could carry out online. Since we were unable to travel outside our homes, the internet became the main form of communication between friends and family. At this time, smartphones in particular became increasingly important as a singular device which could carry out all these functions. Although this change was caused by a devastating global pandemic, it revealed technology’s true potential as a source of convenience. 
</p>
<p>
Even as the pandemic began to slow down, people continued relying on technology to solve issues and make ordinary activities more convenient. People learned to depend on their phones so much that they began carrying out tasks and storing important information within their device, even when it was no longer necessary. Smartphones were increasingly used as wallets, maps, cameras, calendars, and more. Online shopping, for items ranging from groceries to clothes, continued growing in popularity because of its convenience, and online shopping tools such as “Buy Now, Pay Later” were more widely adopted. For those who couldn’t afford to purchase a product all at once, “Buy Now Pay Later” allowed customers to buy products while paying the burdensome full price in smaller, more manageable installments, increasing the accessibility of online shopping.

	<h4>Negative Impacts:</h4>
<p>
That being said, although online e-commerce technology such as Buy Now, Pay Later has undoubtedly boosted the online shopping experience, the rise of online shopping has decreased social interaction. Rather than going to a physical store, many now opt for the convenience of buying items in the comfort of their own home. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping traps users into an uncontrollable shopping spiral. Because Buy Now Pay Later splits payments into smaller installments, users justify their frequent purchases and often spend above their means since such technology establishes the illusion of affordability.
Additionally, smartphones, one of the biggest technological innovations yet that once provided a strong outlet of social connection, have demonstrated our loss of control of the technology we use. The iPhone’s intuitive interface has provided a sense of complete control over our phones, to the point they’ve become an extension of ourselves and we become uncomfortable or anxious without our phones, showing that iPhones may actually be controlling us. 
</p>
<p>
The iPhone’s built-in functions have become so normalized that we expect smartphones to come with pre-installed apps, and we rely on these apps to carry out daily tasks that we used to do without our devices. Important information and essential tools like phone numbers, credit cards, maps, and calendars have all been digitized through the iPhone. While it’s convenient to have all our essential information stored in one place, it also indicates our reliance on technology. Without a map, an address book, or a wallet, losing our phones could lead us to get lost, forget how to reach people, and even lose money. The more we rely on our phones to carry out tasks in our place, the more control we relinquish to our devices as we lose the ability to carry out our tasks without them.

	<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
	As technology continues to advance, it will no doubt play a larger and larger role in the way that we live our lives. Whether it be new ways to stay connected, travel, or revelations in healthcare, these advancements can have an overwhelmingly positive impact on our society. However, as technology has made our lives increasingly more convenient, many have begun relying on it too heavily, some forming an addictive behavior with technology. Further, a reliance on technology such as phones has been found to be linked to multiple mental health effects, such as feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. The immediate convenience that technology offers us undoubtedly increases our comfort, but it also robs us of something we often forget, the human element of our day to day interactions. Whether it be conversing with friends, participating in class, or greeting the grocery store cashier, technology strips us of the social interactions that we were once familiar with. In order to prevent our attachment and overreliance on technology, we need to view technology not as a necessity or essential in our lives, but as a tool to assist and enhance the quality of our lives.
